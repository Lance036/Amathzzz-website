            Amathzzz is an innovative research project developed specifically by STEM 12 Nikola Tesla students from SHS within BES (S.Y. 2023-2024)
            for their subject:Inquiries, Investigations, and Immersion. 
            As part of this project, 
            students explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and mathematics education by studying 
            the functionality and impact of Amathzzz, a math educational chatbot.
            Students engage in hands-on research activities to understand how Amathzzz operates, 
            its capabilities in assisting with math-related queries,
             and its potential benefits for learners. Through data analysis and experimentation, 
             students investigate the effectiveness of Amathzzz in 
             improving math comprehension and problem-solving skills among their peers.    
            The project encourages students to apply critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills as they 
            evaluate Amathzzz's performance and propose recommendations for its optimization. By participating in this research endeavor, 
            STEM Students of Senior High School within Bacoor Elementary School contribute valuable insights to the field of AI-driven education while enhancing 
            their own understanding of mathematics and technology.</p>
